# PhageModels
This repository includes the code I have used in my MSc thesis at University of Auckland, using agent-based simulations to investigate whether antibiotic resistance is evolutionarily stable when carried on prophages.

I was handed almost all of the code by Nobuto Takeuchi, my supervisor, for use in my thesis. When I received it, the the program was an impelementation of Conway's Game of Life.

I created runtime.cpp and heavily modified main.cpp and automaton.cpp, and the respective header files. I also also slightly modified cash-display.cpp.

It should be noted that many of the comments in main.cpp, runtime.cpp, and automaton.cpp are inaccurate.  

For Test1, the folder ending in _vloss0 contains the source code for the simulations in which prophage_loss_rate was set to 0.
